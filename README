NAME
    RT-Extension-ListAllEmailRecipients - Determine all recipients for a
    notification and provide emails via template variables

DESCRIPTION
    ListAllEmailRecipients does a dry run of all scrips configured for a
    notification to determine the full list of email receipients. This list
    is then made available to templates when the actual notification scrips
    are subsequently run to send email.

    The current version calculates emails for comments and replies on
    existing tickets via the web UI and email. It does not calculate
    recipients on create.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 4.4

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add these lines, both are required:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::ListAllEmailRecipients');
            Set(@MailPlugins, qw(Auth::MailFrom Action::ListAllEmailRecipients));

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver
    Modify your templates as described below.

USAGE
    ListEmailReceipients adds the following template variables containing a
    list of all recipients for that type for the current transaction
    (comment, correspond, etc.) across all enabled notification scrips.

        $NotificationRecipientsTo
        $NotificationRecipientsCc
        $NotificationRecipientsBcc

    To include these in an outgoing email, like the Admin email to AdminCcs
    on a ticket, add something like the following to the appropriate
    template:

        <p>Email was sent to the following addresses:</p>

        <p>To: {$NotificationRecipientsTo} </p>
        <p>Cc: {$NotificationRecipientsCc} </p>
        <p>Bcc: {$NotificationRecipientsBcc} </p>
