NAME
    RT-Extension-ListAllEmailRecipients - Determine all recipients for a
    notification and provide emails via template variables

DESCRIPTION
    ListAllEmailRecipients does a dry run of all scrips configured for a
    notification to determine the full list of email receipients. This list
    is then made available to templates when the actual notification scrips
    are subsequently run to send email.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 4.4

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add these lines, both are required:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::ListAllEmailRecipients');
            Set(@MailPlugins, qw(Auth::MailFrom Action::ListAllEmailRecipients));

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver
    Modify your templates as described below.

USAGE
    ListEmailReceipients adds the following template variables containing a
    list of all recipients for that type for the current transaction
    (comment, correspond, etc.) across all enabled notification scrips.

        $NotificationRecipientsTo
        $NotificationRecipientsCc
        $NotificationRecipientsBcc

    To include these in an outgoing email, like the Admin email to AdminCcs
    on a ticket, add something like the following to the appropriate
    template:

        <p>Email was sent to the following addresses:</p>

        <p>To: {$NotificationRecipientsTo} </p>
        <p>Cc: {$NotificationRecipientsCc} </p>
        <p>Bcc: {$NotificationRecipientsBcc} </p>

  Ticket and Transaction IDs
    This extension generates the recipient lists by doing a trial run of the
    incoming action (create, comment, or reply). In doing so, it doesn't
    actually make any changes, but it does increment the ids in the ticket
    and transaction tables and possibly others depending on your scrips.
    This shouldn't matter for most users since ticket ids are arbitrary, but
    some users depend on ticket ids for various reasons. If you have
    processes that depend on specific ticket ids, be aware that using this
    extension will create gaps between ticket and other ids in your
    database.
