NAME
    RT-Extension-ListAllEmailRecipients - List email recipients in the body of
    RT email

DESCRIPTION
    ListAllEmailRecipients searches for recipients in the headers on email
    messages generated by RT and replaces a template placeholder with the
    comma-delimited list of email recipients in the email message body.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 4.2

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        If you are using RT 4.2 or greater, add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::ListAllEmailRecipients');

USAGE
    ListEmailReceipients adds functionality to any RT scrip that uses the
    default 'Notify' action. For these notification scrips, you can add the
    placeholder RT-INSERT-RECIPIENTS to your existing notification template
    and it will be replace with a list of all recipients on that email when
    RT sends out the notification.

    For example, you could add this to your Correspondence template:

        The following people received this email:
        RT-INSERT-RECIPIENTS

    and the resulting email will look like:

        The following people received this email:
        user1@example.com, user2@example.com
